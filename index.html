            <h1>Shanaaz Deo</h1>
            <h3>Data Science and Web/Mobile Application Enthusiast. Ready to take on the world!</h3>
            
            
            <p>My computer science journey began at UC Santa Cruz in Fall 2013. I had entered college with little to no knowledge of what I wanted to pursue.
            I decided to take my first programming class; in this class I learned how to code in java, and I quickly fell in love with the world of technology.</p>

            <p>I first became interested in Data Science when I was accepted for a undergraduate research position in Data Analysis and Visualization my Freshman year. 
            I had gotten my first experience with R Studio, and little did I know that Data Science would play a large part in my life the following years.</p>
              
            <p>My Sohpomore year, I took a Web Applications class. This class gave me my first taste of web development. Although I had experience
            with html/css, I was able to gain extensive experience in not only html/css, but python and javascript as well. </p>
